One entry per merge, newest first. Run the game from the main checkout (this folder, on `main`).

## READY TO TRY: Skeleton (mod loads, world state, debug commands)  (merged feat/core-scaffold, commit 408ef8e)
```
Restart needed: full game restart (new Java code, mixins and a new run config)
See it now:
  1. In VS Code Run and Debug, pick "Dev Client" (or run ./gradlew runDevClient).
     It creates and opens the world "a1016_dev": creative, cheats on, spawn in a Dappled Forest.
  2. /a1016 state
  3. /a1016 fire debug_ping   then   /a1016 fire debug_ping fake
  4. /a1016 stage 2, /a1016 timewarp 3, /a1016 profile reroll, then /a1016 state again
What to look for: /a1016 state prints the stage, attention, tension, clock and this world's rolled profile
  (habits, density, tempo, signature, which fragments exist). Nothing happens in the world on its own. That's correct.
Known rough edges: no director yet, so nothing fires by itself. The old figure prototype is still registered
  (/summon a1016_02:him) and its eyes still glow; the entity worker replaces it in v0.2.
